# Decision Tree Regression:
Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to produce meaningful continuous output. Continuous output means that the output/result is not discrete, i.e., it is not represented just by a discrete, known set of numbers or values.

Discrete output example: A weather prediction model that predicts whether or not thereâ€™ll be rain in a particular day.

Continuous output example: A profit prediction model that states the probable profit that can be generated from the sale of a product.
