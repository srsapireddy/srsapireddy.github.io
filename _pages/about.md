PERSONAL DETAILS
<br><br>

A few interesting things about me. I love to read science fiction. I am also an avid gamer. Lastly, I love learning. Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, software engineering, or miscellaneous facts about the universe.
<br><br>

I just finished my diploma program in Artificial Intelligence at National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology where I have learnt many concepts in machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning. I plan on searching for Data Science positions in Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore.
