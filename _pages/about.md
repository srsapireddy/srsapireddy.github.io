👋 I'm **Srinivas Rahul Sapireddy**, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the **University of Missouri – Kansas City (UMKC)**, where I specialize in low-power hardware-aware AI and VLSI design.

I am currently teaching **Logic Design** and **Engineering Computation**, and have previously instructed **ASIC Physical Design**, **Analog IC Design**, and more. I bring both depth and clarity to technical teaching, backed by practical industry exposure and academic research.

### 🧠 Research & Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **hardware design**, **signal processing**, and **artificial intelligence**. I focus on:

- Efficient activation functions for deep learning on edge devices  
- RF modulation classification using hybrid time-frequency features  
- System-on-Chip (SoC) design and embedded AI acceleration  
- Piecewise linear approximations in neural network deployment  

I’ve worked as a Research Assistant at the **Missouri Institute of Defense and Energy**, and held an AI internship at **SmartBridge Pvt. Ltd.**
