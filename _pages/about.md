My goal is to be an accomplished researcher in Machine Learning. My preferred area of research interests are in Data Mining, Machine Learning and Scientific Computing. Having a penchant for pursuing Research Development in Machine Learning area, I present here my academic accomplishments and career objectives:
<br><br>
I have pursued my undergraduate program in Electrical & Communication Engineering at GokarajuRangaraju Institute of Engineering and Technology (GRIET), affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, JNTU Hyderabad, India. I was ranked among the top 5 percentage among 150 students in our department. Academically, I graduated with a final cumulative average of 3.81/4 (WES Evaluation) which is above the threshold for a first class with distinction.
<br><br>
During my undergraduate studies, I have shown more interest in understanding the core concepts of programming. I had a burning desire to know more about Machine Learning and Data Mining which drove me into the field of Computer Science. During this time, discussions with Professors inspired me to explore multifarious applications in the field of Computing. I developed interest in the subject and began to follow the research activities on Machine Learning and the impact it will make on peopleâ€™s lives.
<br><br>
With this zeal, I secured admission to the Master of Science in Computer Science program at the University of Illinois Springfield. In this program, I have undertaken number of interdisciplinary courses that has helped me to build a strong foundation in programming and database design. Research involved in my course work was aimed at answering important questions related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning which made me to explore different topics like Convolutional Neural Networks, Image Processing and various Machine Learning algorithms. The programming assignments include programming languages like: Java, Python, R. CUDA C, C etc.

After graduating from University of Illinois at Springfield I have joined Advanced Diploma in Artificial Intelligence course in National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology, Calicut, India to further explore the concepts of Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing.
